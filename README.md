# turbotex
A dynamic and customizable HTML textbox, intended to be used in conjunction with a hacked version of TurboWarp's iFrame extension. Combined with the extension hack, this page enables the use of proper text inputs for projects made in TurboWarp, circumventing Scratch's normal input methods in a more seamless manner than the BetterInput extension.
